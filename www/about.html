<p>
The acronym ARCHIE stands for <b>A</b>nother <b>R</b>emote <b>C</b>ommunity <b>H</b>otspot 
for <b>I</b>nstruction and <b>E</b>ducation. The word <i>another</i> is included in the acronym to
acknowledge that it was inspired by other projects, particularly the <b>RACHEL Pi</b> project.
</p>
<p>
The ARCHIE Pi should run on all recent versions of the Raspberry Pi and includes friendly setup
and installation scripts. The server runs on top of a standard Raspberry Pi OS Lite Linux operating
system and a variety of additional open-source software packages. It also includes some 
tuning to reduce to probability of SD card corruption in the event of power failure.
The ARCHIE Pi can make use of a wide variety of open educational resources, like the ones
made available by World Possible at oer2go.org.

The ARCHIE Pi was developed by faculty and students from Calvin University.
